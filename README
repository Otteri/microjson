			microjson README

microjson parses a large subset of JSON directly into static C
structures without using malloc(3).

microjson is very small and very low-footprint, intended for use in
constrained embedded environments.  It may also be of interest for
code where malloc is verboten to reduce reliability and sexurity 
vulnerabilities.
