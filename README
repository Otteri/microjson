			microjson README

microjson parses the largest possible subset of JSON that can be
unpacked directly into static C structures, without using malloc(3).

microjson is very small and very low-footprint, intended for use in
constrained embedded environments.  It may also be of interest for
code where malloc is verboten to reduce reliability and sexurity 
vulnerabilities.
